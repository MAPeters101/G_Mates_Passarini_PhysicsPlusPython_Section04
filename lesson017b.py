# The linear, surface, and volumetric expansions can be calculated,
# respectively, by the following formulas:
# delta_linear = length * lin_exp_coef * delta_temp
# delta_area = area * area_exp_coef * delta_temp
# delta_volume = volume * vol_exp_coef * delta_temp
# Write code that displays a menu for the user showing three options: if he/she
# wants to calculate the linear expansion, he/she must type 1.  if he/she
# # wants to calculate the surface expansion, he/she must type 2. if he/she
# # wants to calculate the volumetric expansion, he/she must type 3.
